## Game: Black Jack 

### Game Description
The goal is reach 21 or get as close as possible without going over. The game starts by clicking the "Start Game!" button. You and the dealer are both dealt 2 cards. The goal is to reach 21 or get as close as possible without going over. You can press hit if you are unhappy with your total sum and play your luck to not go over 21. Once you hit stay, the dealer will draw as many cards needed to reach a sum of 17 or above. Once your sums are matched up, a message will pop up declaring the winner or if it is a tie.

### Technologies Used
Kept it very simple with the technologies. I used basic HTML and CSS to create a neat looking game. Things are nicely placed on screen and nothing overlaps eachother. Went with a dark theme to the website so that you may play for hours without hurting your eyes too much.
Javascript was used to create game logic and making the buttons on the webpage functional.

### Challenging Code Parts
Difficult part for me was figuring out how to attach values to a string of an array. After hours of searching parseInt came up and it was a lifesaver. Still need to do is find a function how to turn the Ace value to 1 or 11 depending on the sum of the hand.

### Next Steps
I would like to make my game more realistic with the card images and better logic to change Ace count depending on score of the game. Have one dealer card flipped to start the game as well. I believe I spent a lot of time on the logic of the game and was in funky spot for a major time of the project before finding the right approach. This project needs a lot more work and I will be putting the time in for it.

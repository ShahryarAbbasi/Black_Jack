# Black Jack By Shahryar Abbasi


Psuedocode: HTML
First screen will be a mostly blank screen with a title of the game and a start button that when clicked takes you to a screen that has a couple images that will have the two players (user and computer) that will compete in a game of Black Jack.

Psuedocode: CSS
Nothing special for the css code, just need to have it organize the items in a neat way and have some colors for adding an element of aesthetics to it. Thinking the overall theme for the game needs to be blue and white minus the cards

Psuedocode: Javascript
* Start by declaring all the DOM variables to work with. 
* Then creating an object that contains all the cards in a deck of cards and their numerical values. 
* Have a player and a computer variable. 
* Start by a computer having two random cards and user having two random cards when the button "Start Game" is clicked.
* Then changing the view of the cards of the user to reveal themselves, followed by options to hit or stay.
* If the cards are hit and the sum of cards exceeds over 21 then game is over and the computer has won.
* If the user chooses stay then the computer cards are revealed.
* Computer has to hit until the sum of its cards are >= 17 and <22.
* if computer sum > user sum the HTML message pops up saying dealer has won.
* if user sum > computer sum the HTML message pops up saying user has won.
* play again button to restart the game.
